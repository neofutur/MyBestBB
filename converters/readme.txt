##                    This converter only supports MySQL-databases.
##
##                    The passwords in some forums are NOT converted due to
##                    differences in password storing between the forums.
##
##                    The converter does not uppdate the search-index, so that
##                    must be done manually (Admin->Maintenance->Rebuild index).
##                    There's also alot of settings that's not converted, so go
##                    through the admin-pages for additional settings.
